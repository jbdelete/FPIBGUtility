Project Proposal

Overview

I have a software application (called FPIBG) that uses the Graphics Processor to perform particle flow simulations.
It is not a Web application so the back and front ends are defined differently. This application is written in C++ using the 
Vulkan API but this will not be part of the project. Instead we are writing code to control it in Python.

It is a great project for people wanting to go into reaserch becasue there is allot of analysis of algoritm performance (time complexity)
and formating analysis data. Nothing is complicated and all of the code is prototyped in Matlab.

The application needs a front-end to configure and launch the FPIBG simulation run and a back-end to produce reports 
from the generated data. I need to use Pyton because the research comunity in the particle simulation field uses it
for these kinds of utilities. It also needs to be portatble across MSWIN, LIMUX, and MACOS.

Front-end

	The front provides the following facilities:
	1. Reads and writes to a configuration file via the libcofig API.	
	2. Reads an image of the flow device in a 3D file format called Wavefront (*.obg) being studied 
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file
	3. Launch and control the simulation via tcp/ip.
	
	The configuration file provides the data for the FPIBG run. One of those configuration items is the profile of the 
	device through which the particles will flow. In the example GUI below shows a Converging-Diverging Nozzel but it can be 
	anything like a section of round pipe. The front-end must be a separate utility that 
	communicates with the application via TCP/IP becasue it can run the FPIBG application 
	locally or it can launch multiple tasks of the application in a High Performance Computing 
	environment (something we won't do here).

Back-end

	The back-end provides the following features.
	1. Reads data generated by the simulation run.
	2. Produces and displays plots of the data.
	3. Writes those plots in Latex format so that they can be ncluded in report documents.
	4. Reads captured image files of each frame and converts the color values at each pixel into scalar or vector fields.
	5. Plots the scalar or vector plots to Latex format for inclusion in reports.
	6. Assembles image files into movies.
